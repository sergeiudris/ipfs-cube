# ipfs-client
like torrent client, but for ipfs, with search

## goal

- like https://github.com/Tribler/tribler torrent client, but for ipfs
- with search: search files on IPFS like tribler and BTDig allow to search torrents
- app should be completely free, open source, no ads or anything - just a program that does its thing
- simple: no ratio limits, no barriers - like transmission on linux, but with search (tribler-like more-hops-if-seeding is fine, as it's not a restriction)
